Cybersecurity is a field that has fascinated me for quite some time. Like many others, I started my journey with little to no knowledge of what the field entailed. It all began when I participated in my college campus CTF (Capture the Flag) challenge. At that time, I didn’t even know what CTF was, nor did I understand the concepts of hacking.

But as I worked through the challenges, I became deeply intrigued by how vulnerabilities are exploited, how systems are breached, and how to defend against these attacks. Despite its complexity, the more I explored, the more fascinated I became with cybersecurity.

Since I didn’t know where to start, I decided to pursue the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**, which seemed like a good starting point. The course introduced me to core concepts such as networking, system security, threat modeling, and incident response.

With the guidance of experienced individuals in the field, I transitioned from theory to practice, gaining real-world experience through various platforms. **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box** became great places to put my knowledge to the test in practical scenarios. Each room I completed brought new challenges and learning opportunities.

## Tools and Skills I’ve Developed

Throughout my cybersecurity journey, I’ve gained proficiency in essential tools for penetration testing and security analysis:

- **Nmap** – Network scanning and vulnerability detection.
- **Wireshark** – Capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- **Burp Suite** – Web application testing, vulnerability scanning, and proxy functionality.
- **Metasploit** – Exploiting vulnerabilities in systems.
- **Linux Command Line (Bash)** – Automation, file management, and penetration testing.
- **Python** – Scripting for automation and data manipulation.
- **SQLMap** – Automating SQL injection testing.

These tools have helped me approach real-world security problems and enhanced my practical skills in the field.

## Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges: My Path to Practical Cybersecurity

Participating in **Capture the Flag (CTF)** challenges has been one of the most rewarding parts of my cybersecurity journey. These challenges offer a unique, hands-on opportunity to test and refine my skills in a real-world, competitive environment.

- **picoCTF** – An excellent platform for beginners, I tackled various beginner-friendly CTFs that focused on fundamental cybersecurity skills like cryptography, reverse engineering, and web application security.
- **Hack The Box** – As I grew more confident, I transitioned to Hack The Box, which offered more complex challenges that allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of penetration testing techniques and exploitation methods.
- **TryHackMe CTF Rooms** – These rooms offered structured challenges that helped me solidify my knowledge and practice new tools in a practical environment, enhancing my problem-solving abilities.

The combination of solving puzzles, exploiting vulnerabilities, and learning new tools has been a highly effective way to deepen my cybersecurity knowledge while keeping the process fun and competitive.

## What’s Next for Me?

- **Advanced Web Pentesting**: Master complex vulnerabilities like SSRF, XXE, and deserialization with custom Burp Suite scripts.
- **Consistent CTF Practice**: Solve challenges on Hack The Box, picoCTF, or TryHackMe.
- **Landing a Job**: Work towards landing a cybersecurity job where I can apply my skills and grow professionally.
